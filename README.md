# listeningtospotify

Applescript on Mac to get the song you're currently listening to on Spotify and broadcast it to the world.

This is a simple script who want to publish what they are listening to on Spotify.

Features:
Currently a Mac only version which runs through Applescript

In order to broadcast, you must have a local and remote server. The local server will be hold a file listing what you are currently listening to. The remote server receives the file via cURL. My scripts were written in PHP for the server transfer but can be done in any language.

Server file examples may be included at another time.
